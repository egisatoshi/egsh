-------------------
THE EG SHELL (EGSH)
-------------------

Version
-------

This is the first version of the shell.  I think there is 
no risk to install and use this software, though it's not 
a good idea to use this shell as your login shell, yet.

About EGSH
----------

'EG' of the "EGSH" derives from the main developer's name
Egi, and the English word 'easy'. I am implementing the shell 
tring to make it as simple as passible.

Installing EGSH
---------------

You can install and use this shell by just following 4 commands.

% tar xvzf ./egsh.tar.gz
% cd egsh
% make
% ./egsh

Removing EGSH
-------------

What you do is only to remove the directory of egsh.

% rm -r egsh

Features
--------
This shell is too weak to have a practical use. I'll keep to 
improve the shell. 

Implemented Features:

- Redirect

You can execute commands like a following one.

% cat text > copytext

- Pipeline

You can execute commnds like a following one.

% ls | grep .c | less

Of course, you can do commands like a following, too.

% ls | grep .c | less > output

- Job Controll

You can suspend the process by pressing Ctr-z, see the 
job list by 'jobs' command, restart the process in the 
forground by 'fg', and in the background by 'bg'. You
can run the process in the background by adding '&' at 
the tail of the command.

Example:
% sleep 5
Ctr-z
19519	SUSPENDED[18]
% sleep 4
Ctr-z
19521	SUSPENDED[18]
% sleep 6 &
% jobs
PGRP	STATE		CMD
19519	suspended	sleep
19521	suspended	sleep
19523	running  	sleep
% bg 19521
% jobs
% fg 19519 //wait few seconds...
19523	DONE
19521	DONE
1952	DONE
% jobs
%

Not Implemented Features:

The shell will support these features in next 
versions.

- Shell Scripting

- Editing Commandline

- History

- Complementation by Tab key
